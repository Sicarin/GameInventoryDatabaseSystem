# Milestones Folder

Welcome to the **Milestones Folder** of our Introduction to Databases course
This folder contains all the technical documentation for the project;
it is organized into five subfolders corresponding to each project milestone.

## Usage

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific milestone and contains all the relevant guidelines associated 
with that phase of your database project. This organization ensures that all project artifacts are easily accessible and
